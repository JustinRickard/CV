While this is sometimes necessary, it should be avoided when possible. From experience, it is always a lot quicker to lay a sturdy foundation first, then write the rest of your code on top of it. The problem with skipping the foundation laying is that once your code works, you then need to dig it up to ensure it is written properly, which often takes more effort than you had predicted. Another disadvantage is that some parts of the foundation never get done as the project deadline looms... and the final product is less robust than you had intended.

Within each class, we could have code along the lines of \"_logger = new NLog.Logger()\" for instantiating the logger, as well as \"_logger.Error(errorMessage)\".

It could be said that a Square class should inherit from the Rectangle class because a square is a rectangle, albeit with an equal height and width. However complications can arise with regards to behaviour, since a method \"SetWidth() on a rectangle would affect the width only, however on a square it should also affect the height. As such, the SetWidth() method becomes inappropriate for a square.\" As such, Square should probably not inherit from Rectangle.";

	Principles_IS_Paragraph3: string = "For example, cars, cement mixers and motorbikes are all vehicles. If we had an IVehicle interface that each class inherited, this may work for methods such as Accelerate(), Brake(), etc. However the cement mixer would have a method Mix(), which the others would not. Also, the Motorbike class may have a method Wheelie() that the others would not. As such, IVehicle is a polluted interface and is not sufficiently flexible.";
	Principles_IS_Paragraph4: string = "Rather than having the one IVehicle interface, we would be better off with several: IDriveable, IMixable and IWheelie (or IWheelieable if you prefer).
